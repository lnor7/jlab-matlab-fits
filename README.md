# jlab-matlab-fits
MATLAB functions for chi-square fits of data, created for use by MIT 8.13 students

Functions included:
- chisquare.m: chi-squared fitting for an arbitrary nonlinear form, uses weighted least-squares minimization
- fitlin.m: closed-form chi-squared fitting for functions of the form y = ax + b. (Provided by the 8.13 staff!)
- fitprop.m: closed-form chi-squared fitting for functions of the form y = ax

The other two files in the repository provide code for the example fitting exercise with NIST data, covered on the MATLAB tutorial on the 8.13 website. The NIST data is contained in gauss3.dat and the fitting routine is in test.m.
